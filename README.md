# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that also happens to be stylish and responsive.

For a thoughtful experience, look out for the toggleable tweet form and ability to scroll seamlessly to the top when your next great idea comes to mind.

To get into the specifics, we've got HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end and a Node Express server on the back-end working very well together.

## A Sneak Peek


## Getting Started

To boot up Tweeter for yourself:

2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
